# AI Persona Chat
The AI Persona Chat Research Platform is an innovative but simple tool designed for research and analysis of linguistic characterstics (such as persuasiveness in LLMs). This platform facilitates the creation of AI personas and enables them to engage in conversations, allowing researchers to explore and understand how different personas interact and persuade each other through text-based conversations.
